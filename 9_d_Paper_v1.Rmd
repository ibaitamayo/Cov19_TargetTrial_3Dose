# Abstract

***

In the estimation of the effectiveness of the booster mRNA vaccines against the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, as well as in any infectious diseases, one of the major limitations is the residual confounding among booster and no booster recipient groups in terms of infection exposure. This is expressed by the incidence differences in the exposed and unexposed groups even before the booster likely effect. In order to address this limitations we compared typical matching variables with matching by the home address. In addition, the evidence regarding the effectiveness in the long-term is scarce. 

In this work we followed the target trial emulation methodology. The effectiveness against infections from 2021-12-17 to 2022-03-31 are analysed. Then, effectiveness against severe cases was assessed from 2021-12-17 to 2022-06-13. The difference of selected periods of follow-up is due to the infections in the general population are not fully recorded from 2022-03-31 whereas the severe cases are. We selected individuals aged 18 years or older who had completed their primary vaccination at least 3 months before the start of follow-up, and had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 since the start of the pandemic, excluding  educational and health-care workers, and nursing home residents from Navarra (region of Spain of 600 000 inhabitants) throughout the BARDENA databases. On each day between 2021-12-17, and 2022-03-30, we matched individuals who had received a booster mRNA vaccine with controls by age (5 years groups), sex, number of previous negative test (0, 1, 2, 3+), type of primary vaccine (homologous or Janssen), time since complete vaccination, health basic zone, migrant status, flu vaccinated in 2020, and in 2021, and the number of people in the households (truncated at eight). We estimated risk of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using the Kaplan-Meier method, with 13 weeks of follow-up and we compared groups using risk ratios (RR). Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as one minus RR. In addition, we use the home address for matching in the same period, balancing the exposition in both groups. Finally, we assessed the long-term effect of the booster against severe cases on a period from 2021-12-17 to 2022-06-13 matching by age, sex and comorbidities.

The estimated effectiveness from day 7 to 35 after a mRNA booster was `r rr_m1_st$rr_eff` for the short-term (7-35 days) and `r rr_m1$rr_eff` for the long-term (7-91 days). In both settings we observed differences between the groups in the first 7 days. However, when the matching was based on sharing home, these differences decrease drastically. In this analysis, the short and mid term effectiveness are `r rr_m2_st$rr_eff` and `r rr_m2$rr_eff` respectively. Finally, the long-term effectiveness of booster in severe cases is high: `r rr_m3$rr_eff`, although there are a low number of cases. 

Summarising, i) it is interesting to have the pseudonymized home address of the participants in order to emulate the target trials and remove confounding, and ii) the booster still had moderate effectiveness against infection, even in the long-term time, and higher effectiveness against hospitalisations with less signs of waning effectiveness.

# Introduction

***

Omicron has been the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide since endings of 2021. The effectiveness of the booster vaccines against the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the short term has been assessed in several works [@Monge2022]. However, for the best of our knowledge, there are not assessed the effectiveness in medium or long term. In addition, in some of the observational studies, some confounding remains between booster and non-booster recipients. We overcome two of the limitations of the aforementioned works: i) the possible residual confounding expressed by the differences in the exposed and unexposed group before the booster likely effect (first seven days [@Walsh2020; @Lustig2021]), and ii) the longer term effect of the booster in infections, hospital admissions and in deaths. To this end, we followed the target trial emulation methodology [@Danaei2013]. The effectiveness of the booster against infections, hospital admissions and deaths were assessed in the period where Omicron was the dominant period in Navarre.

# Methods

***

This work uses the target trial framework. In this approach, a target randomized trial is described and emulated with observational data. In particular, we perform three different target trials to answer each of the three research questions.

## Setting

***

The source population was the whole population of Navarre, a region of Spain of about 600 000 inhabitants. We selected people who had programmed the booster vaccination in the omicron-dominant period. Therefore, we selected individuals aged 18 years or older who had completed their primary vaccination at least 3 months before the start of follow-up, and had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 since the start of the pandemic. In addition, educational and health-care workers, and nursing home residents are also excluded since their vaccination calendar is different to the general population. We obtain all the information throughout the BARDENA databases [@Bardena2022].
  
For assessing the booster effectiveness against COVID-19 infection, the selected period was from 2021-12-25 to 2022-03-31. Omicron was the dominant strain since epidemiological week 52 of 2021 and after Apr 1, 2022 the Spanish government change the surveillance methodology and not all the infections were registered. On the other hand, the selected period for assessing the effectiveness against hospital admissions and deaths due to COVID-19 infection was 2021-12-25 to 2022-06-13 as the data about admissions and deaths is reliable even after the Mar 31, 2022.

## Target trial emulation

***

First, we compare booster and no booster recipients and we follow them until the infection is produced, death or the end of the follow-up. In case of the non-treated component of the pair receives the booster, both components are censored.

The second trial is identical to the first, but matching for home address. This, allows to reduce the residual confounding between treated and non-treated. However, the sample obtained will be disminished. 

Finally, in the third trial, we compare individuals from 2021-12-25 to 2022-06-13 where the outcomes of interest were hospital admissions and deaths. 

## Statistical analysis

***

From eight days before the start to the end of the selected period, individuals who had received a booster mRNA vaccine were matched according to the target trial. In the first target trial (TT A) the boosted recipients are matched with no boosted controls by age (5 years groups), sex, number of previous negative test (0, 1, 2, 3+), type of primary vaccine (homologous or Janssen), time since complete vaccination, health basic zone, migrant status, flu vaccinated in 2020, and in 2021, and the number of people in the households (truncated at eight). We estimated risk of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using the Kaplan-Meier method, with 10 weeks of follow-up and we compared groups using risk ratios (RR). Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as one minus RR and expressed as percentage. 

In the second target trial (TT B), we use the home address for matching in the same period, balancing the exposition in both groups. Finally, in the third target trial (TT C) we assessed the long-term effect of the booster against hospital admissions and deaths matching by age, sex and comorbidities.

# Results

***
  
The estimated effectiveness from day 7 to 34 after a booster was 51·3% (95%CI 50·2, 52·4) in Spain [@Monge2022], meanwhile in Navarra region was `r rr_m1_34$rr_eff` for the short-term (7-34 days) and `r rr_m1_70$rr_eff` for the mid-term (7-70 days). In both settings we observed differences between the groups in the first 7 days (Fig 1A). However, when the matching was based on sharing home, these differences decrease drastically. In this analysis, the short and mid term effectiveness are `r rr_m2_34$rr_eff` and `r rr_m2_70$rr_eff` respectively (Fig 1B). Finally, the mid-term effectiveness of booster in severe cases is high: `r rr_m4_70$rr_eff`, although there are a low number of cases (Fig 1C).

# Discussion

***

Summarising, i) it is interesting to have the pseudonymized home address of the participants in order to emulate the target trials and remove confounding, and ii) the booster had moderate effectiveness against infection, even in the mid-term time, and higher effectiveness against hospitalisations.
