We commend Monge et al for their insightful analysis of the effectiveness of the booster vaccines in Spain against the omicron variant of SARS-Cov-2 [@Monge2022]. We try to enhance two of the limitations of the aforementioned work: i) the differences in the exposed and unexposed group before the booster likely effect (first seven days [@Walsh2020; @Lustig2021]), and ii) the longer effect of the booster in infections and in severe cases. This has been done following the target trial emulation methodology [@Danaei2013]. The results of infections from 2022-01-04 to 2022-03-31 (after this date, the infections notified are less reliable) are compared with [@Monge2022]. Last, effectiveness against severe cases is assessed from 2022-01-04 to 2022-06-13.

We select individuals aged 40 years or older who completed their primary vaccination at least 3 months before the start of follow-up, and had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 since the start of the pandemic, excluding  educational and health-care workers, and nursing home residents from Navarra (region of Spain of 600 000 inhabitants) throughout the BARDENA databases [@Bardena2022].
  
On each day between Jan 3, and March 30, 2022, we matched individuals who received a booster mRNA vaccine and controls of the same age (5 years groups), sex, number of previous negative test (0, 1, 2, 3+), type of primary vaccine (homologous or Janssen), time since complete vaccination, health basic zone, migrant status, flu vaccinated in 2020, flu vaccinated in 2021, and the number of people at home (truncated at eight). We estimated risk of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using the Kaplan-Meier method, with 10 weeks of follow-up and compared groups using risk ratios (RR). Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as one minus RR. In addition, we use the home address for doing the matching in the same period, balancing the exposition in both groups. Finally, we assess the mid-term effect of the booster against severe cases on a period from 2022-01-03 to 2022-06-13.
  
The estimated effectiveness from day 7 to 34 after a booster was 51·3% (95%CI 50·2, 52·4) in Spain [@Monge2022], meanwhile in Navarra region was `r rr_m1_34$rr_eff` for the short-term (7-34 days) and `r rr_m1_70$rr_eff` for the mid-term (7-70 days). In both settings it is observed differences between the groups in the first 7 days (Fig 1A). However, when the matching is done by the home address, these differences decrease drastically. In this analysis, the short and mid term effectiveness are `r rr_m2_34$rr_eff` and `r rr_m2_70$rr_eff` respectively (Fig 1B). Finally, the mid-term effectiveness of booster in severe cases is high: `r rr_m3_70$rr_eff`, although there are a low number of cases (Fig 1C). 

Summarising, i) in order to emulate the target trials it is interesting have the exact home address of the participants to remove confounding, and ii) the booster has moderate effectiveness against infection, even in the mid-term time, and higher effectiveness against hospitalisations.
